# 4 byte burger - theme for GarlicOS on Anbernic RG35XX
Artwork originally Jack Haege (Amiga, 1985), restored by [Ahoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4EFkspO5p4)

My first theme for this lovely device. The idea was inspired by this beatiful piece of art, the *four byte burger* and made me want to reuse it somehow. The rest of the stuff was created by me. 
Might create more stuff for Garlic later but it's a bit limited to UI reskins at the moment.  

### info

You can find every asset in [**this**](https://www.figma.com/file/BQiohG2Ppo6M1e43ptLCng/4-byte-burger---GarlicOS-theme?type=design&node-id=112%3A2997&mode=design&t=SbXIFdAbM2jWepDl-1) Figma document. Figma is a design tool, you can easily export multiple artboards with a click, or copy the file and play around with it. You can find the original assets on the second page.

Figma exports high quality PNGs, no option to compress. I recommend compressing them with PS, Gimp or an online tool like Photopea. 90% reduction results in very low file sizes (basically less colors), still decent visuals and very snappy system. Otherwise it was lagging for me. The boot image cannot be compressed as it is a BMP, but thats fine.

You can play around with the settings in the language/English.json or settings.json.
